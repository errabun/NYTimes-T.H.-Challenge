## NY Times Take Home Challenge

## Description

 - This challenge was presented as a mock take home challenge to practice time-boxing building an app from a prompt as we may see in a future job interview.  The prompt/rubic can be found [here](https://mod4.turing.edu/projects/take_home/take_home_rubric).  The main goal was to be able to speak to how we approached the rubric (as it is relatively vague) and our processes on how we were going to complete each part of the rubric. We were to utilize the New York Times API for all the resources. 


## Installation
1. Clone down this [repo](https://github.com/errabun/NYTimes-T.H.-Challenge)
2. CD into project directory
3. Run npm i to install all project dependencies
4. Run npm start to begin the server
5. Application should be shown in separate window once npm start is complete


## Walkthrough

- Once on the dashboard view, the user will be prompted to select a genre of news that they would like to view some of the most recent published articles from the NY Times. 
- The user will select the button 'View Articles' and be redirected to another page where they will see a list of article titles from pertaining to the genre they selected on the previous page, along with the authors names who published the article.  
- User will be able to select an article by clicking on the title to be redirected to another page where they will get more information on the article (date published, a small abstract blurb about article, etc) as well as a redirect link that will take them to view the full article on the NY Times website. 
- At any time, the user will be able to click on the app title in the header, 'News on Demand', and be redirected to the dashboard where they will be able to select a different genre of news to view.

### Project Progression

Given the short amount of time that was provided to complete this challenge, planning was paramount in figuring out what I needed to include and what could be left out.  I began by builidng a wireframe on Miro, [check it out](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_l4US4WI=/), to layout the design of how I envisioned the app looking.  This is where I put down my thoughts as to what features were going to be implemented as well.  From there, I built out each component and carefully considered what a good user flow would be.  I really wanted to test myself by staying within the time constraints, so unfortunately I did not get around to adding very much styling to the page.  However, I did achieve all the needed features laid out in the rubric in the allotted time.
